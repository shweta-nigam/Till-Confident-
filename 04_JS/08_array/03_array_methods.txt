🎯 First: The Golden Rule (Memory Trick)

Arrays are like kitchen shelves.

Some methods are “Peaceful Guests” → they don’t touch your shelf, only show you something or give you a copy.

Some are “Chaotic Guests” → they change your shelf directly.

Some are “Delivery Boys” → they return new items without messing with your shelf.

Remember this table:

CATEGORY	WHAT THEY DO	TYPE OF GUEST
Mutating Methods	Change original array	Chaotic Guests 😈
Non-Mutating Methods	Don’t change original	Peaceful Guests 😇
Create new array	Give new array	Delivery Boys 🚚
😈 MUTATING METHODS (They change the original array)

Think of them like people who come into your house and rearrange your furniture without asking.

1. push()

👉 Adds items at the end.
😈 Changes original.

Think: “PUSH more things inside my shelf from the back.”

let a = [1,2];
a.push(3); // a becomes [1,2,3]

2. pop()

👉 Removes from end.
😈 Changes original.

Think: “POP the last item off the shelf.”

3. shift()

👉 Removes from front.
😈 Changes original.

Think: “SHIFT the first item away.”

4. unshift()

👉 Adds items at front.
😈 Changes original.

Think: “UN-SHIFT by inserting items at start.”

5. splice()

👉 Add/Remove/Replace anywhere.
😈 The MOST chaotic method.

Think: “SP-LICE = Surgeon. Cuts and stitches your array.”

6. sort()

👉 Sorts array alphabetically by default.
😈 Mutates AND confuses beginners.

Think: “SORT is that friend who rearranges your room ‘for your own good.’”

7. reverse()

👉 Reverses array in place.
😈 Flips your shelf upside-down.

😇 NON-MUTATING METHODS (They don’t change original)

Peaceful monks. They just observe and give you information.

1. slice()

👉 Gives a piece of the array without modifying the original.

Think:
“SLICE the cake and give me a piece, but don’t touch the cake.”

let a = [1,2,3,4];
let b = a.slice(1,3); // [2,3]

2. concat()

👉 Combines arrays and returns a new array.

Think:
“CONCAT = Gently join hands, no one gets hurt.”

3. includes()

👉 Checks if value exists.

Think:
“Is this item included on my shelf?”

4. indexOf()

👉 Finds index of item.

Think:
“Where is this item located?”

5. join()

👉 Converts array → string.

Think:
“JOIN everyone together with a separator.”

🚚 METHODS THAT RETURN NEW ARRAYS (Functional heroes)

These are the delivery boys — they bring back a new modified array but don’t touch the old one.

1. map()

👉 Apply a function to each element → return new array.

Think:
“MAP = Everyone changes their outfit, but ORIGINAL people remain.”

[1,2,3].map(x => x * 2); // [2,4,6]

2. filter()

👉 Keeps only values that pass a test.

Think:
“FILTER = Only allow cool people in the club.”

[1,2,3,4].filter(x => x % 2 === 0); // [2,4]

3. reduce()

👉 Reduces array to one value.

Think:
“REDUCE = Make a smoothie out of all fruits.”

4. flat()

👉 Flattens nested arrays like unrolling a bedsheet.

5. flatMap()

👉 map() + flat() (depth 1)

Think:
“Flip and flatten in one go.”

🧠 HOW TO NEVER FORGET AGAIN

Use this short rule:

✔ If the method sounds violent → it mutates

push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, sort, reverse

✔ If the method sounds calm or “intellectual” → no mutation

slice, concat, includes, indexOf, find

✔ If it sounds like magic transformation → returns NEW array

map, filter, reduce, flat, flatMap
